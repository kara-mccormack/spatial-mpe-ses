Cluster Notes

Uploading file to cluster

Need to be sitting in the folder on personal machine where file is 
located. Then:

scp filename kem81@dcc-slogin-02.oit.duke.edu:~/spatial-mpe-ses

Getting into R in the cluster
Once in compute node (can be in working directory, wherever data or R 
scripts are located in cluster): 

module load R/3.5.2

R

Once in R, can simply install.packages(). Then the next time you
load R, can just library() to get packages.
